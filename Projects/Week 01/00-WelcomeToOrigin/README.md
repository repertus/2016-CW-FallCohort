# Day 1 - Welcome to Origin!

> *The object isn't to make art, it's to be in that wonderful state which makes art inevitable.*<br />
> **Robert Henri**

First of all - welcome to Origin Code Academy and congratulations for taking an amazing first step toward a successful career in Software Development!

Today will not be heavy on learning new coding topics, instead we will be focusing on one of the most crucial components of being a happy and successful software developer..

## Make yourself a nice place to work.

Today will mostly be about ensuring that everybody is prepared for the next 12 weeks of learning. The goal is to remove as much friction as possible so that you can focus on the course instead of any obstacles that could have been avoided day one.

### Parking
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

We have partnered with Ace in Horton Plaza to provide parking for our students.

- [ ] Walkthrough of plans offered by Ace from one of their representatives.
- [ ] Coordinate with administration to organize parking.

### Building Access
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

You have access to the building 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. As we are in the midst of summer - it's important to note that the AC is only on Monday-Friday between the hours of 9-5. We provide box fans if you want to come in on the weekend or stay late after class.

- [ ] Receive your building access card and key from administration.

### Hardware Setup
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

You will be spending a lot of time working on the computer in the next 12 weeks, and it's important that you spend that time as productively as possible. Slow computers mean slow learning, so this is a great opportunity to gain back valuable hours in the day to spend learning instead of waiting for your computer to catch up with you.

The best thing you can do to speed up your computer is to buy and install a Solid State Drive (or SSD) to replace the existing Hard Disk Drive (or HDD) in your computer. For a rundown of the difference between the two and why an SSD provides such a dramatic performance boost - check out the following article. https://www.backblaze.com/blog/hdd-versus-ssd-whats-the-diff/

**Tasks**

- [ ] Ask your instructor to review your hardware.

### Software Setup 
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

Make sure you have signed up for all the necessary accounts and installed the necessary software to complete the course. You may have already completed this step when you were given a link to our [Syllabus](https://github.com/origincodeacademy/syllabus) repository - double check again, as there have been a couple of additions that have been added recently.

#### Signup for these Accounts
* [ ] [GitHub](https://www.github.com) - You will use this to store your source code online and get feedback from your instructor. You'll almost certainly end up using this for the rest of your career in software development as well.
* [ ] [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com) - This is how almost all recruiters will find you when you start looking for jobs. Don't worry too much about filling in every field for now, our careers team will help you fine tune this later in the course.
* [ ] [WakaTime](https://www.wakatime.com) - Think of WakaTime as a "fitbit for programmers". It will measure how long you spend coding each day. This is a great way for you to earn more XP in [The Origin Game](https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/Syllabus/tree/master/The%20Origin%20Game)!

#### Install these applications

*Required for Week 1-4*
* [ ] [Sublime Text 3](http://www.sublimetext.com/) - You will use this to edit HTML, CSS and JavaScript files.
* [ ] [Resilio](https://www.getsync.com/) - (Previously named BitTorrent Sync) Every session will be recorded and uploaded to a shared Resilio folder.
* [ ] [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) - This is the primary browser we will be using for web development. It is currently the most popular browser, and also has a fantastic set of development tools to help you debug your web applications.
* [ ] [Postman (Chrome Extension)](https://www.getpostman.com/) - A tool we will be using to test out APIs that we create later in the course. 
* [ ] [Git command line utility](https://www.git-scm.com) - You will use this in command prompt to communicate with GitHub.
* [ ] [NodeJS (LTS)](https://www.nodejs.org/) NodeJS is the swiss army knife of the development world.

*Required for Week 4-12*
* [ ] [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads) - `For Mac users only` - An application that allows you to run Windows on your Mac. This is a free solution, but there is a paid alternative that offers improved performance named [Parallels](https://www.parallels.com/). As of writing, it currently costs $79.99. Along with VirtualBox/Parallels - you will also need a legitimate copy of Windows. In the shared Resilio folder, you will find an ISO for Windows 10 Enterprise edition, provided to you through our MSDN subscription with Microsoft.
* [ ] [Visual Studio Community 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com/en-us/visual-studio-homepage-vs.aspx) - An IDE we will be using to write C# applications. (Note - this is not the same thing as Visual Studio Code - a lighter editor similar to Sublime Text).

#### Make sure you are invited to:
* [ ] Our GitHub organization (If you can read this - you're good to go!)
* [ ] Our Slack team

### The Origin Game 
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

We are introducing a new component to the experience at Origin Code Academy called *The Origin Game* - an experience (XP) based game where you can earn points for completing assignments, number of hours spent coding, showing up to class on time, and even for points completed on Team Treehouse!

The game is mostly passive - you will earn points automatically during ceremonies at the end of each day/week, and regularly throughout the course when you complete assignments and are checked in by an instructor. 

- [ ] Follow all of the steps outlined in [The Origin Game](https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/Syllabus/tree/master/The%20Origin%20Game).

<hr />

### Rest of the Day 
[Back to top](#table-of-contents)

- [ ] Read [A Brief Introduction to Scrum](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/scrum) by Atlassian.
- [ ] Read [The Scrum Guide](http://www.scrumguides.org/docs/scrumguide/v1/scrum-guide-us.pdf).
- [ ] Review our [Coding Standards](https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/Syllabus/blob/master/Best%20Practices/Coding%20Standards/Frontend/Front-end%20Coding%20Standards.md) for Week 1
- [ ] `Extra` Read [What Agile Means for the everyday developer](https://www.atlassian.com/agile/developer) by Atlassian.
- [ ] Continue working on Team Treehouse for the rest of the day, focusing on JavaScript and jQuery as tomorrow we will dive straight in with a coding assignment using this language and library.
