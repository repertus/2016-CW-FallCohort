# San Diego Top Spots

There are some great places to see in downtown San Diego. In this project you'll get to know a few of them by turning the provided JSON file into a table in HTML with links to Google Maps using jQuery.

## Yak Shaving
1. Download and install the LTS version of NodeJS (4.4.3) from their website https://nodejs.org/
2. Open up command line and run the following command `npm install -g node-static` to install a quick-and-easy HTTP server. This is important because the `$.getJSON` method you will be using will use an HTTP request to grab a JSON file. This cannot be done through the `file://` protocol, you must use `http://` - which can only be accomplished by running an http server to serve your HTML files.

## Tasks
1. Create a folder named `04-SanDiegoTopSpots` in your `dev` folder.
2. Setup your Git workflow.
  - Initialize an empty git repository in `04-SanDiegoTopspots` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
  - Create a repository on GitHub called `04-SanDiegoTopspots` and follow the instructions to add a remote origin.
3. Open this folder in your favorite text editor (Ours is Sublime!)
4. Create an `index.html` file and a corresponding `index.js` file.
5. Download [topspots.json]("https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/2016-CW-FallCohort/tree/master/Projects/Week%201/04-SanDiegoTopSpots/topspots.json") to your `04-SanDiegoTopspots` folder.
6. Create an HTML `table` structure with the headers you see in the image above.
7. Also make sure you reference your `index.js` before the `</body>` tag.
8. Write the following JavaScript in your `index.js` file
   - Use the `$.getJSON` method to download the contents of [topspots.json]("https://github.com/OriginCodeAcademy/2016-CW-SpringCohort/tree/master/Projects/Week%201/04-SanDiegoTopSpots/topspots.json")
   - Iterate through the top spots and create rows for each spot.
   - Create a link to the location using the longitude and latitude provided. (Example https://www.google.com/maps?q=33.09745,-116.99572)
9. To start/test your application - navigate to `04-SanDiegoTopSpots` in command line and run `static .` to start a web server that you can access by going to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Extras
- Have a play with the [Google Maps Javascript API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/) and see if you can draw all the locations in the JSON file into markers on an embedded Google Maps element. (Difficult!)
