## Tasks

**1. Set up your repository**
* Create a new repository on GitHub called **07-BudgetTracker**.

**2. Write the application** 
1. Create a folder named `07-BudgetTracker` in your `dev` folder.
2. Setup your Git workflow.
  - Initialize an empty git repository in `07-BudgetTracker` by running `git init` in the command prompt.
  - Create a repository on GitHub called `07-BudgetTracker` and follow the instructions to add a remote origin.
3. Open this folder in your favorite text editor (Ours is Sublime!)
4. Create an `index.html` file.
5. Design your HTML page to look like the screenshot using Bootstrap or another preferred design framework.
6. Make use of the following AngularJS features to build this application.
	- Two way data binding using the `ng-model` directive and one way data binding using the `{{}}` bindings (commonly called moustache brackets!).
	- Click event binding using the `ng-click` directive.
	- Dynamic CSS using the `ng-class` directive.
	- Iteration using the `ng-repeat` directive.

**3. Add some extras**
* Personal finance gurus recommend reducing your *largest expenses* before you stop buying coffee at Starbucks. Modify your application to create a list of no more than 5 suggestions of expenses the user can reduce.
* Typically, your rent should not exceed 25% of your monthly take home pay. If the user has any expenses that mention the words "House", "Rent" or "Mortgage" and that expense exceeds 25% of their income - add a suggestion that the users rent exceeds 25% of their take home pay.
