# Fun with Linq Queries

For this exercise, you will learn how to make the same kind of SQL queries you wrote yesterday in the context of a C# application using Language Integrated Query (or, Linq!)

You will also be exposed to Unit Testing in Visual Studio, and some more best practices for writing Web API controllers - such as returning `IHttpActionResult` and instantiating your Entity Framework Database Context in the constructor. 

The solution contains a test project with already populated tests that you can use to make sure your code works correctly. Refer to today's video to see how to run these.

## Tasks

* You should make sure you have the `NORTHWND` database in your SQL Server instance.
* Fork and Clone the [LinqExercises](https://github.com/cameronoca/linq-exercises) repository.
* Open the Controllers folder in LinqExercises.Test and explore the pre-written tests.
* Open the Controllers folder in LinqExercises and explore the pre-written method shells.
* Your task is to implement these method shells using Linq.
* For guidance on how to complete this project, watch today's video - or here are some good resources for picking up the basics of LINQ.

## Extras
* Write your own controller methods (or, API Endpoints) that return data you think might be useful from the NorthWind database.
* Write matching Unit Tests for these new Controller Methods/API Endpoints.
